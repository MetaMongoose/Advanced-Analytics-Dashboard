# Advanced-Analytics-Dashboard
Analytical tasks are performed in Python using Supervised &amp; Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Objective
To build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results of
an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

## Data Requirements for this project were:
● Be open source
● Come from an authentic/authoritative source;
● Include non-anonymized column names;
● Be no more than 3 years old (up to a maximum of 10 years if you’ve found a perfect data set
  for your needs and no newer data is available);
● Contain at least 2 continuous variables (excluding index or ID variables, dates, years, etc.);
● Contain at least 2 categorical variables (excluding index or ID variables, dates, years, etc.);
● Contain at least 1,500 rows;
● Include a geographical component with at least 2 different values 

## Dataset
I chose to use a life expectancy dataset which I obtained from kaggle.com. The original data was sourced from the Worldbank,
and I was able to confirm this by looking directly at the data avaible from Worldbank.
